The django-tvdb has some pre-configured settings.

They can be modified by adding a dict variable called ``TVDB`` in your ``settings.py`` and customizing the values ​​you want;

The ``TVDB`` dict variable contains these settings and defaults:


.. code:: django

    # Default settings
    TVDB = {}
